PlanetScale only supports MySQL. If you are looking for PlanetScale for Postgres, the closest product
is [Neon](https://neon.tech/). You can check out [PlanetScale vs. Neon](https://www.bytebase.com/blog/planetscale-vs-neon/)
for a detailed comparison.

## Will PlanetScale support Postgres?

![planetscale-feature](/blog/planetscale-postgres/planetscale-feature.webp)

The chance are small in the near future. Because many of the PlanetScale's features
such as Branching, Sharding, Revert are highly dependent on the underlying [Vitess](https://vitess.io/).
And Vitess only speaks MySQL.

Well, never say never.
